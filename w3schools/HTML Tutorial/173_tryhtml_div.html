      <h2>London</h2>
      <p>
        London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in
        the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million
        inhabitants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two
        millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who
        named it Londinium.
